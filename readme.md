# Boxxy

BOXes are eXiting - Yesire!

A opinionated (but configurable) vs code plugin to create boxes and lines of [box-drawing characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character) for your inner queen.


## Commands (planned)

```
Smart command:
    If in a box drawing area:
        if overwrite is enabled:
            place a line at current char
        else:
            enable overwrite
    else:
        if overwrite is enabled:
            disable overwrite
        else:
            ask width for a new box drawing
```
